 abstract = {Access to data in typologically diverse languages enables greater study of cross-linguistic variation. Previous study in the area of phonetic typology has been limited to few widely-spoken languages for which data is available. The CMU Wilderness dataset is the first highly multilingual speech dataset with transcribed recordings of continuous speech from 699 languages. For many of these languages, this is the only existing language resource. However, use of this dataset is restricted by copyright, extensive computational requirements, and necessary domain knowledge to adapt methods to new low-resource languages. We remove these prerequisites by deriving and releasing speech measurements for immediate use. In this paper we describe the methodology to create our resource, and demonstrate its utility for research in phonetic typology through a series of case studies. All data and scriptswill be released for non-commercial use.},
