To do this, researchers train \"probes\"— supervised models designed to extract linguistic structure from embeddings. The line between what constitutes a probe and a model designed to achieve a particular task is often blurred. To fully understand what we are learning about the target language representation—or the instrument with which we performing measurement with for that matter—we would do well to compare probes to classic parsers. As a case study, we consider the structural probe (Hewitt and Manning, 2019), designed to quantify the presence of syntactic information. We create a simple parser that improves upon the performance of the structural probe by 11.4% on UUAS, despite having an identical lightweight parameterization. Under a second less common metric, however, the structural probe outperforms traditional parsers.

This class of techniques, of which label smoothing is one, has a connection to entropy regularization. Despite the consistent success of label smoothing across architectures and data sets in language generation tasks, two problems remain open: (1) there is little understanding of the underlying effects entropy regularizers have on models, and (2) the full space of entropy regularization techniques is largely unexplored. We introduce a parametric family of entropy regularizers, which includes label smoothing as a special case, and use it to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the entropy of a model and its performance on language generation tasks. We also find that variance in model performance can be explained largely by the resulting entropy of the model. Lastly, we find that label smoothing provably does not allow for sparsity in an output distribution, an undesirable property for language generation models, and therefore advise the use of other entropy regularization methods in its place.

Probes are a natural way of assessing this. When probing, a researcher chooses a linguistic task and trains a supervised model to predict annotations in that linguistic task from the network's learned representations. If the probe does well, the researcher may conclude that the representations encode knowledge related to the task.  A commonly held belief is that using simpler models as probes is better; the logic is that simpler models will identify linguistic structure, but not learn the task itself. We propose an information-theoretic formalization of probing as estimating mutual information that contradicts this received wisdom: one should always select the highest performing probe one can, even if it is more complex, since it will result in a tighter estimate, and thus reveal more of the linguistic information inhering in the contextualized representation. The empirical portion of our paper focuses on obtaining tight estimates for how much information BERT knows about both parts of speech and dependency labels, evaluating it in a set of ten typologically diverse languages often under-represented in parsing research, plus English, totalling eleven languages.  We find BERT only accounts for more information about parts of speech than a traditional type-based word embedding in five of the eleven analysed languages. When we look at dependency labels, BERT does improve upon type-based embeddings in all analysed languages, but accounting for at most 12% more information.","tags":null,"title":"Information-Theoretic Probing for Linguistic Structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emanuele Bugliarello","Sabrina J.

XMI allows us to better evaluate the difficulty of translating text into the target language while controlling for the difficulty of the target-side generation component independent of the translation task.

Class membership is far from deterministic, but the phonological form of a noun and/or its meaning can often provide imperfect clues. Here, we investigate the strength of those clues. More specifically, we operationalize this by measuring how much information, in bits, we can glean about declension class from knowing the form and/or meaning of nouns. We know that form and meaning are often also indicative of grammatical gender \u0026mdash; which, as we quantitatively verify, can itself share information with declension class \u0026mdash; so we also control for gender. We find for two Indo-European languages (Czech and German) that form and meaning respectively share significant amounts of information with class (and contribute additional information above and beyond gender). The three-way interaction between class, form, and meaning (given gender) is also significant. Our study is important for two reasons: First, we introduce a new method that provides additional quantitative support for a classic linguistic finding that form and meaning are relevant for the classification of nouns into declensions. Secondly, we show not only that individual declensions classes vary in the strength of their clues within a language, but also that these variations themselves vary across languages.

The default algorithm for this job is beam search---a pruned version of breadth-first search---which in practice, returns better results than exact inference due to beneficial search bias. In this work, we show that standard beam search is a computationally inefficient choice for many decoding tasks; specifically, when the scoring function is a monotonic function in sequence length, other search algorithms can be used to reduce the number of calls to the scoring function (e.g., a neural network), which is often the bottleneck computation. We propose best-first beam search, an algorithm that provably returns the same set of results as standard beam search, albeit in the minimum number of scoring function calls to guarantee optimality (modulo beam size).  We show that best-first beam search can be used with length normalization and mutual information decoding, among other rescoring functions.  Lastly, we propose a memory-reduced variant of best-first beam search, which has a similar search bias in terms of downstream performance, but runs in a fraction of the time.","tags":null,"title":"Best-First Beam Search","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ran Zmigrod","Tim Vieira","Ryan Cotterell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"bc982261ed6c38ce3a82eb15d72e7917","permalink":"https://rycolab.github.io/publication/zmigrodal-tacl-20/","publishdate":"2020-09-26T06:11:23.743062Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zmigrodal-tacl-20/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Efficient Computation of Expectations under Spanning Tree Distributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adina Williams","Ryan Cotterell","Lawrence Wolf-Sonkin","Damian Blasi","Hanna Wallach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"f81a6754c8d2a554ad1123f73967933b","permalink":"https://rycolab.github.io/publication/williamsal-tacl-20/","publishdate":"2020-09-26T06:11:22.629471Z","relpermalink":"/publication/williamsal-tacl-20/","section":"publication","summary":"We use large-scale corpora in six different gendered languages, along with tools from NLP and information theory, to test whether there is a relationship between the grammatical genders of inanimate nouns and the adjectives used to describe those nouns.

We perform an empirical comparison of these approaches on the English Gigaword and Wikipedia, and find that whilst both successfully reduce direct bias and perform well in tasks which quantify embedding quality, CDA variants outperform projection-based methods at the task of drawing non-biased gender analogies by an average of 19% across both corpora. We propose two improvements to CDA: Counterfactual Data Substitution (CDS), a variant of CDA in which potentially biased text is randomly substituted to avoid duplication, and the Names Intervention, a novel name-pairing technique that vastly increases the number of words being treated.

Are there some types of language that are easier to model with current methods? In prior work (Cotterell et al., 2018) we attempted to address this question for language modeling, and observed that recurrent neural network language models do not perform equally well over all the high-resource European languages found in the Europarl corpus. We speculated that inflectional morphology may be the primary culprit for the discrepancy. In this paper, we extend these earlier experiments to cover 69 languages from 13 language families using a multilingual Bible corpus. Methodologically, we introduce a new paired-sample multiplicative mixed-effects model to obtain language difficulty coefficients from at-least-pairwise parallel corpora.

Since morphology obeys the principle of compositionality, the semantics of the word can be systematically derived from the meaning of its parts. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic model of word formation that captures both the analysis of a word w into its constituent segments and the synthesis of the meaning of w from the meanings of those segments. Our model jointly learns to segment words into morphemes and compose distributional semantic vectors of those morphemes. We experiment with the model on English CELEX data and German DErivBase (Zeller et al., 2013) data. We show that jointly modeling semantics increases both segmentation accuracy and morpheme F1 by between 3% and 5%.

In contrast, we propose to keep the traditional architecture, which uses a finite-state transducer to score all possible output strings, but to augment the scoring function with the help of recurrent networks. A stack of bidirectional LSTMs reads the input string from leftto-right and right-to-left, in order to summarize the input context in which a transducer arc is applied. We combine these learned features with the transducer to define a probability distribution over aligned output strings, in the form of a weighted finite-state automaton.

For instance, two words may be similar with respect to semantics, syntax, or morphology inter alia. Continuous word-embeddings have been shown to capture most of these shades of similarity to some degree. This work considers guiding word-embeddings with morphologically annotated data, a form of semi-supervised learning, encouraging the vectors to encode a word’s morphology, i.e., words close in the embedded space share morphological features. We extend the log-bilinear model to this end and show that indeed our learned embeddings achieve this, using German as a case study.","tags":null,"title":"Morphological Word Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan Cotterell","Jason Eisner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1435708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435708800,"objectID":"db153a927a072c4049d322aa1f4dfc77","permalink":"https://rycolab.github.io/publication/cotterelleisner-naacl-15/","publishdate":"2020-04-20T10:10:24.471872Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cotterelleisner-naacl-15/","section":"publication","summary":"We present penalized expectation propagation (PEP), a novel algorithm for approximate inference in graphical models. Expectation propagation is a variant of loopy belief propagation that keeps messages tractable by projecting them back into a given family of functions. Our extension, PEP, uses a structuredsparsity penalty to encourage simple messages, thus balancing speed and accuracy. We specifically show how to instantiate PEP in the case of string-valued random variables, where we adaptively approximate finite-state distributions by variable-order n-gram models. On phonological inference problems, we obtain substantial speedup over previous related algorithms with no significant loss in accuracy.","tags":null,"title":"Penalized Expectation Propagation for Graphical Models over Strings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan Cotterell","Nanyun Peng","Jason Eisner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"585f26f2d387f8189154c38ea4fd00a6","permalink":"https://rycolab.github.io/publication/cotterellal-tacl-15/","publishdate":"2020-04-20T10:10:23.509194Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cotterellal-tacl-15/","section":"publication","summary":"The observed pronunciations or spellings of words are often explained as arising from the ''underlying forms'' of their morphemes. These forms are latent strings that linguists try to reconstruct by hand. We propose to reconstruct them automatically at scale, enabling generalization to new words. Given some surface word types of a concatenative language along with the abstract morpheme sequences that they express, we show how to recover consistent underlying forms for these morphemes, together with the (stochastic) phonology that maps each concatenation of underlying forms to a surface form. Our technique involves loopy belief propagation in a natural directed graphical model whose variables are unknown strings and whose conditional distributions are encoded as finite-state machines with trainable weights. We define training and evaluation paradigms for the task of surface word prediction, and report results on subsets of 7 languages.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling Word Forms Using Latent Underlying Morphs and Phonology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan Cotterell","Nanyun Peng","Jason Eisner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1401580800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1401580800,"objectID":"98faa9c135408e6a0e6802b0a788931b","permalink":"https://rycolab.github.io/publication/cotterellal-acl-14/","publishdate":"2020-04-20T10:10:54.993291Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cotterellal-acl-14/","section":"publication","summary":"String similarity is most often measured by weighted or unweighted edit distance d(x, y).

The course project/assigment will be worth 30% of your final mark. The project would be an open-ended research project where students reimplement an existing research paper or perform novel research if they are so inclined. Please find the guidelines below. In the assignment, some of the questions would be more theoretical and resemble the questions you will see on the final exam. However, there may also be a large coding portion in the assignment, which would not look like the exam questions. For instance, we may ask you to implement a recurrent neural dependency parser. Please find the first portion of the assignment and the writeup template below.\nAssignments must be completed individually. Projects can be completed in groups of up to 4. If you choose to do the project, we require a proposal no later than November 1, 2020 23:59 CEST. Please see project guidelines for content/formatting instructions; email proposals to Clara (email address below) by the deadline. All projects/assigments will be due at the end of the semester.\nMaterials  Project Guidelines Course Assignment: Part 1 Course Assignment LaTex Template  Contact You can ask questions on piazza. Please post questions there, so others can see them and share in the discussion. If you have questions which are not of general interest, please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to contact us directly.\n  Lecturer Ryan Cotterell   Teaching Assistants Clara Meister, Niklas Stoehr, Pinjia He, Rita Kuznetsova    ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d9362ba48d7ba4daca6705a375cfc5c6","permalink":"https://rycolab.github.io/classes/intro-nlp/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/classes/intro-nlp/","section":"classes","summary":"This course presents topics in natural language processing with an emphasis on modern techniques, primarily focusing on statistical and deep learning approaches.
